        <h3>What is it and why?</h3>
        <p>
          AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
        </p>
        <p>Helps you stay on the same development environment as in this lab, so you won't have dependency issues.</p>
